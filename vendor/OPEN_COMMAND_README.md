# Let's Measure Command

[OpenCommand](https://x.com/open_command) measures **command** using the pitch location's distance from target.

This repo contains 2024/2025/2026 computer vision object detections and the full inference pipeline for producing **target estimates** and resulting **command scores**.

OpenCommand is on par with the state-of-the-art command trackers, outperforming human-annotated trackers.  
It also predicts BB% better than BB% itself!

- This includes glove dependence + offset, both shrunk pitcher → league and pitch type → pitch type × handedness.

#### 2026-08-21: Added 2024 season

#### 2026-08-21: Version 1.1.0
- Targets are now chosen at the *highest glove position in the pre-pitch window<sup>1</sup>, [discounted by how early it is**](https://x.com/open_command/status/2090795304086041066?s=20).*

## How it Works

### Summary
- *See [here](https://x.com/tomdoyo/status/2087272169852088752) for visuals!*
- Estimate camera position with broadcast strikezone & ball detection
- Estimate camera zoom/pan/tilt with broadcast strikezone & camera position
- Estimate glove location with camera position/zoom/pan/tilt/roll & glove detection
- Estimate target with glove location
- Estimate command with target & actual location

### Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt          
```

### Pipeline

Every script in `src/` takes upstream CSVs and writes **one** output.  
And they're standalone: `python src/<script>.py [year=2026] ...`  
(This means you can work on a single stage by regenerating just that stage's file!)

### In detail

*See [here](https://x.com/tomdoyo/status/2087272169852088752) for visuals!*

#### **1. Solving camera pose** (every pitch)
- The CF camera is a fixed mount per game that pans/tilts/zooms per pitch.
- Estimate *where* the camera is:
  - Statcast's 9-parameter equation `(xyz_0, xyz_velo, xyz_acc)` gives us ball position in time (through pitch trajectory).
  - Broadcasts draw strikezone as `(17in width, sz_top/sz_bot)` at the front of the plate (middle for 2026).
  - These give us **12+** datapoints per pitch (8+ ball pixels, 4 box corners) to fit<sup>1</sup> **7** parameters: `(Cx, Cy=400`<sup>2</sup>`, Cz, pan, tilt, roll, f, t0)`.
  - Just keep the game median `Cx`/`Cz`<sup>3</sup>.
- Fit (pan, tilt, roll, f) separately with fixed `(Cx, Cy, Cz)`.
  - Use the drawn strikezone at a snapshot pre-pitch<sup>4</sup>.
  - Don't use ball positions because camera often moves mid-ball flight.

<sub><sup>1</sup> Levenberg-Marquardt on the pixel reprojection error, with a soft_l1 loss.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Camera depth (`Cy`) is degenerate against focal length (`f`): moving camera back and zooming in produce nearly the same pixels. Not a big deal down the line so `Cy` is fixed at 400.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Others are nuisance parameters.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Snapshot is taken when glove is at the highest point in the [release-2.0s, release-0.3s] window.</sub>

#### **2. Solving glove location** (every frame)
- `glove_px/pz` is a 2D projection of glove onto the camera.
- Use camera pose `(Cx, Cy, Cz, pan, tilt, roll, f)` to unproject detected `glove_px/pz` into *global* `glove_xyz`<sup>1</sup>.

<sub><sup>1</sup> Like `Cy`, glove depth (`glove_y`) is really hard to estimate. So we assume `glove_y` to be -1.75ft (median catch depth).<br>

#### **3. Inferring target with glove locations**
- Take the highest `glove_xz` in the [release-2.0s, release-0.3s] window, discounted by how early it is<sup>1</sup>. This is the **naive** target.
- Some pitchers don't look at the glove, some adjust more than an inch per inch of glove movement. Fit 4 slopes (xx, xz, zx, zz) for how much the target moves per inch the glove moves. This is **glove dependence**.
- Many pitchers like to "start the pitch from the glove and let the ball break away from it". To account for this, add an **offset**.
- Both are a 2 level hierarchical model fit by empirical Bayes: each pitcher shrinks to the league, each pitch type shrinks to its pitch type × handedness distribution (a changeup lands about 4 inches below the pitcher's average, a four-seam 4 above), so a pitch type with 10 pitches gets a sane value instead of a 0 inch miss. Glove dependence + offset is the **inferred target**.
  - This assumes every pitcher is **perfectly calibrated** on a pitch type level.
- Use plausibility filter<sup>2</sup> to filter out extreme targets.

<sub><sup>1</sup> This is mainly to avoid decoy targets, usually when the runner is on second base.<br>
<sup>2</sup> (`|x|` over 20in, `z` outside the pitch-type floor/cap)</sub>

#### **4. Scoring command**
- `miss` = distance from the actual location to target.
- For leaderboards, **median** miss is used, after plausible target filter.

## Data

### Download

The data lives on Hugging Face.

```
pip install huggingface_hub
hf download tomdoyo/open-command --repo-type dataset --local-dir data
```

To take one file instead of all of them:

```
hf download tomdoyo/open-command 2026/command_scores.csv --repo-type dataset --local-dir data
```

### Layout

Each season lives under `data/<year>/`. 

**Keys:** `(game_pk, play_id)` identify a pitch.

Raw detections (in `data/<year>/raw/`) are produced using YOLO11 glove/ball/strikezone detector models, with postprocessing based on detection confidence.

| File (per season) | One row per | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `pbp_info.csv.gz` | pitch | Statcast 9-parameter trajectory, `sz_top`/`sz_bot`, plate location, pitcher, pitch type, and the game_date/type/venue |
| `raw/gloveball_tracks/<game_pk>.csv.gz` | frame | glove + ball detections (pixels on screen) |
| `raw/strikezone_tracking.csv.gz` | clip | broadcast strikezone detections (pixels on screen) |
| `camera_poses.csv.gz` | clip | camera pose (+ vote diagnostics & reprojection accuracies) |
| `glove_locations/<game_pk>.csv.gz` | detection | solved glove location (real-world) |
| `targets.csv.gz` | clip | naive/inferred targets |
| `command_scores.csv` | pitcher, pitch type | n, naive and inferred median miss |

### Coverage

OpenCommand tracks nearly all the pitches that it *can*, with most clips lost being due to *no strikezone detected*<sup>1</sup> and *late center field camera cut*<sup>2</sup>.

**For 2025:** 90.00 / 93.17% possible

| Funnel loss | Clips Lost (%) | Remaining | Coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| All pitches | — | 724,005 | 100.00% |
| Clip never published | 763 (-0.11%) | 723,242 | 99.89% |
| No strikezone detected | 30,447 (-4.21%) | 692,795 | 95.69% |
| No ball release detected | 11,719 (-1.62%) | 681,076 | 94.07% |
| Late center field camera cut | 18,267 (-2.52%) | 662,809 | 91.55% |
| Low detection quality | 8,036 (-1.11%) | 654,773 | 90.44% |
| Implausible target | 3,142 (-0.43%) | **651,631** | **90.00%** |

<sub><sup>1</sup> Sometimes broadcasts don't draw a strikezone box on the screen<br>
<sup>2</sup> Sometimes camera cuts to CF-cam (i.e. pitcher-batter view) too late</sub>

## Topics

### Target maps

A nice feature is that you can tell where the pitcher was *trying* to throw, which is really hard just looking at the final location.

### Results

#### How good is OpenCommand?

- *See [here](https://x.com/open_command/status/2094029112507859241) for visuals!*
- Inferred miss stabilizes 10x faster than Location+.
- Inferred miss is stickier year-to-year than Location+, and even Stuff+.
- Inferred miss correlates to BB% nearly as well as Location+.
- Inferred miss predicts rest-of-season BB% better than BB% itself until about 600 pitches.

#### How close is OpenCommand to ground truth?

- OpenCommand is the [closest model to ground truth](https://x.com/open_command/status/2098417530427621640).
- True median miss for **fastballs** is probably [7 to 10 inches](https://x.com/tomdoyo/status/2082066794404294671).
- Inferred miss assumes every pitcher perfectly calibrates his pitches, but most pitchers are probably an inch or two off. At the same time, most pitchers fine tune their targets (beyond the catcher's glove) every pitch, depending on the situation. Perhaps these two cancel off on a season-level. 
- So, on a season-level, OpenCommand has a good chance of being accurate within <1 inch. On a pitch-level, certainly not. 

#### How important is command?

- Going from worst to best command is [worth 1 ERA](https://x.com/open_command/status/2099096754520264972) (at the MLB level).
- For reference, going from worst stuff to best stuff is [worth 3 ERA](https://x.com/open_command/status/2099239577697337394).
- There might be a [minimum command](https://x.com/open_command/status/2099538707606802457) to be competitive.
